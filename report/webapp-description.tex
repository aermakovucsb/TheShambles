\chapter{Webapp Description}

The features available on gTrack can be depicted using a flowchart presented in Figure 1. The features include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User Sign Up: Using bcrypt, we implemeted a secure user sign up process that lets an interested visitor of the website become a registered user. Uniqueness of e-mail identification is ensured to prevent different users signing up with the same e-mail address.
	\item Accessing game information: Authenticated users are equipped to navigate through the website to search for games using different criteria. They are also presented with a detailed list of games that are present in Steam. Each game on this website contains relevant information about the game. A user can also view previous comments made by other users on a game and can make a comment him/herself. Authenticated users can also up or down vote a game and see the number of up and downvotes associated with a game.
	\item Chatroom: Registered users can access the in website chat room, gChat to communicate with other users.
\end{enumerate}
