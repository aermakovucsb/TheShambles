# gTrack: Tracking Prices of Games Available in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)

## About
gTrack is a web app to track prices of games available in Steam. It allows the user to observe the trend in change in prices of games and make predictions on future prices. Apart from tracking/predicting prices, the app deals with various Steam related features such as emotes, backgrounds, and cards. Moreover, a user can provide system specifications and find out whether he/she can run a particular game, or just see a list of games runnable in the system.
